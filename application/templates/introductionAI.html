  In this experiment you will be asked to answer 16 multiple choice logic questions.
  After answering the question, the same question will be shown again, but with an AI prediction of the answer. The accuracy of the AI is 63%.
  With this prediction you can reconsider you answer, and answer the question again.
  For each question we have a context paragraph, you should answer the question according to this context.
  You can only select one answer, chose the one that (most) accurately answers the question.
  After selecting the answer you can click confirm and continue to go to the next question.
  Besides, these logic questions you will also be asked to fill out two short questionnaires.
  You will first start with part 1 consisting of 6 questions, then a part 2 consisting of 4 questions and last part 3 consisting of 6 questions.
