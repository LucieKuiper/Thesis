"Professor Hartley' s new book on moral philosophy contains numerous passages that can be found verbatim in an earlier published work by Hartley' s colleague, Professor Lawrence.

"Physician: In comparing our country with two other countries of roughly the same population size, I found that even though we face the same dietary, bacterial, and stress-related causes of ulcers as they do, prescriptions for ulcer medicines in all socioeconomic strata are much rarer here than in those two countries. It' s clear that we suffer significantly fewer ulcers, per capita, than they do.","Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the physician's argument?",The two countries that were compared with the physician's country had approximately the same ulcer rates as each other.,The physician's country has a much better system for reporting the number of prescriptions of a given type that are obtained each year than is present in either of the other two countries.,A person in the physician's country who is suffering from ulcers is just as likely to obtain a prescription for the ailment as is a person suffering from ulcers in one of the other two countries.,Several other countries not covered in the physician's comparisons have more prescriptions for ulcer medication than does the physician's country.,2,val_322,B

It is now the planting season for soybeans, another of Centralia' s principal crops, and those fields originally intended for corn are dry enough for planting.
