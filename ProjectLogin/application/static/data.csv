"One of the things lenders do in evaluating the risk of a potential borrower defaulting on a loan is to consider the potential borrower' s credit score. In general, the higher the credit score, the less the risk of default. Yet for mortgage loans, the proportion of defaults is much higher for borrowers with the highest credit scores than for other borrowers.","Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the statements above?",Mortgage lenders are much less likely to consider risk factors other than credit score when evaluating borrowers with the highest credit scores.,Most potential borrowers have credit scores that are neither very low nor very high.,Credit scores reported to mortgage lenders are based on collections of data that sometimes include errors or omit relevant information.,A potential borrower's credit score is based in part on the potential borrower's past history in paying off debts in full and on time.,0,val_319
"Essayist: Only happiness is intrinsically valuable; other things are valuable only insofar as they contribute to happiness. Some philosophers argue that the fact that we do not approve of a bad person' s being happy shows that we value happiness only when it is deserved. This supposedly shows that we find something besides happiness to be intrinsically valuable. But the happiness people deserve is determined by the amount of happiness they bring to others. Ttherefore, __.",Which one of the following most logically completes the final sentence of the essayist's argument?,the judgment that a person deserves to be happy is itself to be understood in terms of happiness,people do not actually value happiness as much as they think they do,the notion that people can be deserving of happiness is ultimately incoherent,the only way to be assured of happiness is to bring happiness to those who have done something to deserve it,0,val_202
"No one in the French department to which Professor Alban belongs is allowed to teach more than one introductory level class in any one term. Moreover, the only language classes being taught next term are advanced ones. So it is untrue that both of the French classes Professor Alban will be teaching next term will be introductory level classes.",The pattern of reasoning displayed in the argument above is most closely paralleled by that in which one of the following arguments?,"New buildings that include public space are exempt from city taxes for two years and all new buildings in the city's Alton district are exempt for five years, so the building with the large public space that was recently completed in Alton will not be subject to city taxes next year.","All property on Overton Road will be reassessed for tax purposes by the end of the year and the Elnor Company headquarters is on Overton Road, so Elnor's property taxes will be higher next year.","The Morrison Building will be fully occupied by May and since if a building is occupied by May the new tax rates apply to it, the Morrison Building will be taxed according to the new rates.","The revised tax code does not apply at all to buildings built before 1900, and only the first section of the revised code applies to buildings built between 1900 and 1920, so the revised code does not apply to the Norton Building, since it was built in 1873.",0,val_320
"Some advertisers offer certain consumers home computers free of charge. Advertisements play continuously on the computers' screens whenever they are in use. As consumers use the computers to browse the Internet, information about their browsing patterns is sent to the advertisers, enabling them to transmit to each consumer advertising that accurately reflects his or her individual interests. The advertisers can afford to offer the computers for free because of the increased sales that result from this precise targeting of individual consumers.",Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?,At least some consumers who use a computer offered free of charge by advertisers for browsing the Internet spend more money on purchases from those advertisers than they would if they did not use such a computer to browse the Internet.,The advertisers would not be able to offer the computers absolutely free of charge if advertisements that accurately reflected the interests of the computers' users did not play continuously across the computers' screens whenever they were in use.,No advertisers could offer promotions that give away computers free of charge if consumers never used those computers to browse the Internet.,"There are at least some consumers who browse the Internet using computers offered free of charge by the advertisers and who, if they did not use those computers to browse the Internet, would spend little if any money on purchases from those advertisers.",0,val_135
"Professor Beckstein: American Sign Language is the native language of many North Americans. Ttherefore, it is not a foreign language, and for that reason alone, no student should be permitted to satisfy the university' s foreign language requirement by learning it. Professor Sedley: According to your argument, students should not be allowed to satisfy the university' s foreign language requirement by learning French or Spanish either, since they too are the native languages of many North Americans. Yet many students currently satisfy the requirement by studying French or Spanish, and it would be ridiculous to begin prohibiting them from doing so.",Their statements commit Professors Beckstein and Sedley to disagreeing about which one of the following?,whether the fact that a language is the native language of many North Americans justifies prohibiting its use to fulfill the university's foreign language requirement,whether any other universities in North America permit their students to fulfill a foreign language requirement by learning American Sign Language,whether American Sign Language is the native language of a significant number of North Americans,whether any North American whose native language is not English should be allowed to fulfill the university's foreign language requirement by studying his or her own native language,0,val_186
"A photograph of the night sky was taken with the camera shutter open for an extended period. The normal motion of stars across the sky caused the images of the stars in the photograph to appear as streaks. However, one bright spot was not streaked. Even if the spot were caused, as astronomers believe, by a celestial object, that object could still have been moving across the sky during the time the shutter was open, since__.",Which of the following most logically completes the argument?,the spot was not the brightest object in the photograph,stars in the night sky do not appear to shift position relative to each other,the spot could have been caused by an object that emitted a flash that lasted for only a fraction of the time that the camera shutter was open,"if the camera shutter had not been open for an extended period, it would have recorded substantially fewer celestial objects",2,val_362
"One way to compare chess-playing programs is to compare how they perform with fixed time limits per move. Given any two computers with which a chess-playing program is compatible, and given fixed time limits per move, such a program will have a better chance of winning on the faster computer. This is simply because the program will be able to examine more possible moves in the time allotted per move.",Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?,"If a chess-playing program is run on two different computers and is allotted more time to examine possible moves when running on the slow computer than when running on the fast computer, it will have an equal chance of winning on either computer.",How fast a given computer is has no effect on which chess-playing computer programs can run on that computer.,"In general, the more moves a given chess-playing program is able to examine under given time constraints per move, the better the chances that program will win.","If one chess-playing program can examine more possible moves than a different chess-playing program run on the same computer under the same time constraints per move, the former program will have a better chance of winning than the latter.",2,val_312
"Environment minister: Because of our concern about global warming, this country has committed itself to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide substantially over the next ten years. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, planting large numbers of trees will help us fulfill our commitment.","Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the environment minister's argument?","When ground is disturbed in the course of planting trees, more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by rotting organic matter in the soil than the new trees will absorb in ten years.",Owners of large tracts of private land are usually unwilling to plant trees unless they are given a financial incentive for doing so.,Many climate researchers believe that global warming is such an urgent problem that carbon dioxide emissions should be substantially reduced in less than ten years.,"Gases other than carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, and trees do not absorb any of these other gases.",0,val_354
"Hunter: Hunters alone are blamed for the decline in Greenrock National Forest' s deer population over the past ten years. Yet clearly, black bears have also played an important role in this decline. In the past ten years, the forest' s protected black bear population has risen sharply, and examination of black bears found dead in the forest during the deer hunting season showed that a number of them had recently fed on deer.","In the hunter's argument, the boldface portion plays which of the following roles?",It is a judgment that the argument opposes.,It is an objection that has been raised against the main conclusion of the argument.,It is the main conclusion of the argument.,It is a finding that the argument seeks to explain.,2,val_222
"Fortune-teller: Admittedly, the claims of some self-proclaimed ""psychics"" have been shown to be fraudulent, but the exposure of a few charlatans cannot alter the fundamental fact that it has not been scientifically proven that there is no such thing as extrasensory perception (ESP). Furthermore, since the failed attempts to produce such a proof have been so numerous, one must conclude that some individuals do possess ESP.",The reasoning in the fortune-teller's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument,takes for granted that the fact that a claim has not been demonstrated to be false establishes that it is true,overlooks the possibility that some of the scientific studies mentioned reached inaccurate conclusions about whether ESP exists,takes for granted that proof that many people lack a characteristic does not establish that everyone lacks that characteristic,takes for granted that the number of unsuccessful attempts to prove a claim is the only factor relevant to whether one should accept that claim,0,val_361
"Zoologist: It is true that over the past 15 years, there has been a fourfold increase in government funding to preserve endangered species, while the number of endangered species needing such preservation has increased by only 70% (there were, however, a large number of endangered species to begin with 15 years ago). Taking into account inflation, the amount of funding is at least double what it was 15 years ago. Nevertheless, the current amount of funding from the government for species preservation is inadequate and must be enhanced.","Which one of the following, if true, most helps to reconcile the zoologist's conclusion with the above evidence?",The two government agencies responsible for species preservation are typically under budget and are known for an utter lack of cooperation.,"Unlike today, funding for the preservation of species was essentially nonexistent 15 years ago.","Over the past 15 years, the salaries of conservationists employed by the government to work on species preservation solutions have increased at a rate twice that of inflation.","Within the past 15 years, there have been breakthroughs in species demography that allow scientists to identify those species most in need of protection far before they face any real risk of extinction.",1,val_29
"A large survey of scientists found that almost all accept Wang' s Law, and almost all know the results of the Brown-Eisler Experiment. But those results together with Wang' s Law contradict the Minsk Hypothesis. Ttherefore, most of the scientists surveyed reject the Minsk Hypothesis.",The argument requires assuming which one of the following?,Wang's Law has in fact been shown to be true.,The scientists surveyed are generally aware that the results of the Brown-Eisler Experiment together with Wang's Law contradict the Minsk Hypothesis.,The sample is large enough to be representative of scientists in the field.,Almost all of the scientists surveyed are familiar with the way in which the results of the Brown-Eisler Experiment were obtained.,1,val_82
"Some years ago, an editorial defended United States government restrictions on academic freedom, arguing that scientists who receive public funding cannot rightly ""detach themselves from the government' s policies on national security. ""Yet the same editorial criticized the Soviet government for not allowing scientists to ""detach themselves from politics. "" If there is a significant difference between the principles involved in each case, the editorial should have explained what that difference is.",The author of the passage criticizes the editorial by,disputing certain factual claims made in the editorial,drawing a conclusion from the editorial different from the conclusion drawn by the writer of the editorial,pointing out an apparent inconsistency in the editorial,refuting an assumption on which the argument of the editorial appears to have been based,2,val_489
"Radial keratotomy (RK), a surgery that is designed to reshape the cornea so that light focuses correctly on the retina, is supposed to make eyeglasses or contact lenses that correct for nearsightedness unnecessary. Yet a study of patients who have undergone RK shows that some of them still need to wear glasses or contact lenses.","Each of the following, if true, would help to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above EXCEPT:","The more severe a patient's nearsightedness, the less effective the corneal reshaping of RK will be in correcting the problem.","RK patients who originally suffered from only mild nearsightedness may, if the cornea does not heal evenly, develop an astigmatism that requires corrective lenses.","As the eye heals from an operation to correct nearsightedness, it may in fact overcorrect, causing the person to be farsighted.",Those who choose to undergo RK tend to be as nearsighted before this operation as those who choose not to undergo RK.,3,val_150
"Selena: Asteroid impact on the Earth caused the extinction of the dinosaurs by raising vast clouds of dust, thus blocking the Sun' s rays and cooling the planet beyond the capacity of the dinosaurs, or perhaps the vegetation that supported them, to adapt. A worldwide dust layer provides evidence of asteroid impact at approximately the correct time, and a huge crater exists on the edge of the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Trent: That asteroid crater is not large enough for the requisite amount of dust to have been produced. Besides, the extinction of dinosaur species took many years, not just one or two. So the extinctions must have been due not to asteroid impact on the Earth but to some other kind of cause.",Trent's argument assumes that,dinosaurs in the neighborhood of an asteroid impact but not within the zone of direct impact would have survived such an impact,dust from the impact of an asteroid on the Earth would not have had any cooling effect on the climate,no more than one large asteroid struck the Earth during the period when the dinosaurs were becoming extinct,any collision of an asteroid with the Earth would have occurred on a land area rather than an ocean,2,val_4
"Because visual inspection cannot reliably distinguish certain skin discolorations from skin cancers, dermatologists at clinics have needed to perform tests of skin tissue taken from patients. At Westville Hospital, dermatological diagnostic costs were reduced by the purchase of a new imaging machine that diagnoses skin cancer in such cases as reliably as the tissue tests do. Consequently, even though the machine is expensive, a dermatological clinic in Westville is considering buying one to reduce diagnostic costs.",Which of the following would it be most useful for the clinic to establish in order to make its decision?,Whether the visits of patients who require diagnosis of skin discolorations tend to be shorter in duration at the clinic than at the hospital,Whether the machine at the clinic would get significantly less heavy use than the machine at the hospital does,Whether the principles on which the machine operates have been known to science for a long time,"Whether in certain cases of skin discoloration, visual inspection is sufficient to make a diagnosis of skin cancer",1,val_58
"Physiologist: The likelihood of developing osteoporosis is greatly increased by a deficiency of calcium in the diet. Dairy products usually contain more calcium per serving than do fruits and vegetables. Yet in countries where dairy products are rare, and fruits and vegetables are the main source of calcium, the incidence of osteoporosis is much lower than in countries where people consume a great deal of calcium from dairy products.","Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent discrepancy described by the physiologist?",A healthy human body eventually loses the excess calcium that it takes in.,There are more people who have a calcium deficiency than there are who have developed osteoporosis.,The fats in dairy products tend to inhibit the body's calcium absorption.,Many people who eat large quantities of fruits and vegetables also consume dairy products.,2,val_493
"Music historian: Some critics lament the fact that impoverished postwar recording studios forced early bebop musicians to record extremely short solos, thus leaving a misleading record of their music. But these musicians' beautifully concise playing makes the recordings superb artistic works instead of mere representations of their live solos. Furthermore, the conciseness characteristic of early bebop musicians' recordings fostered a compactness in their subsequent live playing, which the playing of the next generation lacks.","The music historian's statements, if true, most strongly support which one of the following?",The difficult postwar recording conditions had some beneficial consequences for bebop.,Musicians will not record extremely short solos unless difficult recording conditions force them to do so.,Short bebop recordings are always superior to longer ones.,Representations of live solos generally are not valuable artistic works.,0,val_285
"Oil analysts predict that if the price of oil falls by half, the consumer' s purchase price for gasoline made from this oil will also fall by half.","Which one of the following, if true, would cast the most serious doubt on the prediction made by the oil analysts?",Studies in several countries show that the amount of gasoline purchased by consumers initially rises after the price of gasoline has fallen.,There are many different gasoline companies that compete with each other to provide the most attractive price to consumers.,Gasoline manufacturers will not expand their profit margins.,"Refining costs, distribution costs, and taxes, none of which varies significantly with oil prices, constitute a large portion of the price of gasoline.",3,val_291
"Professor Hartley' s new book on moral philosophy contains numerous passages that can be found verbatim in an earlier published work by Hartley' s colleague, Professor Lawrence. Ttherefore, in view of the fact that these passages were unattributed in Hartley' s book, Hartley has been dishonest in not acknowledging the intellectual debt owed to Lawrence.",Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument is based?,Hartley considered the passages in question to be the best possible expressions of the ideas they contain.,Hartley could not have written the new book without the passages in question.,A book on moral philosophy should contain only material representing the author's own convictions.,Lawrence did not get the ideas in the passages in question or did not get their formulations originally from Hartley.,3,val_499
"Currently, no satellite orbiting Earth is at significant risk of colliding with other satellites or satellite fragments, but the risk of such a collision is likely to increase dramatically in the future. After all, once such a collision occurs, it will probably produce thousands of satellite fragments, each large enough to shatter other satellites. The resulting collisions will produce many more fragments, and so on, causing the space around Earth to become quite heavily cluttered with dangerous debris.",Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the claim that the risk of a satellite orbiting Earth colliding with other satellites or satellite fragments is likely to increase dramatically in the future?,It is a claim that serves as the argument's conclusion.,It is a claim that provides nonessential background information for the argument's conclusion.,It is an unsupported claim that is used to provide support for the argument's conclusion.,"It is a claim for which the argument provides some support, and which in turn is used to support the argument's conclusion.",0,val_389
"Heavy rains during Centralia' s corn planting season prevented some farmers there from planting corn. It is now the planting season for soybeans, another of Centralia' s principal crops, and those fields originally intended for corn are dry enough for planting. Nonetheless, even though soybean prices are unusually high at present, the farmers will leave most of these fields empty rather than plant them with soybeans, since__.",Which of the following most logically completes the passage below?,some Centralian farmers anticipate serious financial losses due to the extremely wet spring planting season,the extensive rains have led to an increase in the price of corn,chemicals that were used to prepare the fields for corn planting would stunt the growth of soybeans,many Centralian farmers grow both corn and soybeans,2,val_243
"Physician: In comparing our country with two other countries of roughly the same population size, I found that even though we face the same dietary, bacterial, and stress-related causes of ulcers as they do, prescriptions for ulcer medicines in all socioeconomic strata are much rarer here than in those two countries. It' s clear that we suffer significantly fewer ulcers, per capita, than they do.","Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the physician's argument?",The two countries that were compared with the physician's country had approximately the same ulcer rates as each other.,The physician's country has a much better system for reporting the number of prescriptions of a given type that are obtained each year than is present in either of the other two countries.,A person in the physician's country who is suffering from ulcers is just as likely to obtain a prescription for the ailment as is a person suffering from ulcers in one of the other two countries.,Several other countries not covered in the physician's comparisons have more prescriptions for ulcer medication than does the physician's country.,2,val_322
"Investment banker: Democracies require free-market capitalist economies, because a more controlled economy is incompatible with complete democracy. But history shows that repressive measures against certain capitalistic developments are required during the transition from a totalitarian regime to a democracy. Thus, people who bemoan the seemingly anticapitalistic measures certain governments are currently taking are being hasty.",Which one of the following is an assumption required by the investment banker's argument?,A free-market economy is incompatible with a nondemocratic regime.,No current government has reached as complete a state of democracy as it is possible for a government to reach.,The nations whose anticapitalistic measures the people in question bemoan had totalitarian regimes in the recent past.,"The more democratic a country is, the less regulated its economy must be.",2,val_211
"A certain cultivated herb is one of a group of closely related plants that thrive in soil with high concentrations of metals that are toxic to most other plants. Agronomists studying the herb have discovered that it produces large amounts of histidine, an amino acid that, in test-tube solutions, renders these metals chemically inert. Possibly, ttherefore, the herb' s high histidine production is what allows it to grow in metal-rich soils, a hypothesis that would gain support if __.",Which of the following most logically completes the argument?,the concentration of histidine in the growing herb declines as the plant approaches maturity,"cultivation of the herb in soil with high concentrations of the metals will, over an extended period, make the soil suitable for plants to which the metals are toxic","histidine is found in all parts of the plant-roots, stem, leaves, and flowers",others of the closely related group of plants are also found to produce histidine in large quantities,3,val_155
"Further evidence of a connection between brain physiology and psychological states has recently been uncovered in the form of a correlation between electroencephalograph patterns and characteristic moods. A study showed that participants who suffered form clinical depression exhibited less left frontal lobe activity than right, while, conversely, characteristically good-natured participants exhibited greater left lobe activity. Thus one' s general disposition is a result of the activity of one' s frontal lobe.","Each of the following, if true, weakens the argument EXCEPT:",Social interaction of the kind not engaged in by most clinically depressed people is known to stimulate left lobe activity.,"Excessive sleep, a typical consequence of clinical depression, is known to suppress left lobe activity.",Many drugs prescribed to combat clinical depression act by causing increased left lobe activity.,Frontal lobe activity is not subject to variation the way general disposition is.,2,val_142
"A university psychology department received a large donation from a textbook company after agreeing to use one of the company' s books for a large introductory course. The department chair admitted that the department would not have received the donation if it used another company' s textbook, but insisted that the book was chosen solely for academic reasons. As proof, she noted that the department' s textbook committee had given that textbook its highest rating.","Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the case for the department chair's position?",The textbook company does not routinely make donations to academic departments that use its books.,The members of the textbook committee were favorably influenced toward the textbook by the prospect of their department receiving a large donation.,"In the previous year, a different textbook from the same company was used in the introductory course.",The department has a long-standing policy of using only textbooks that receive the committee's highest rating.,1,val_190
"Economist: Tropicorp, which constantly seeks profitable investment opportunities, has been buying and clearing sections of tropical forest for cattle ranching, although pastures newly created there become useless for grazing after just a few years. The company has not gone into rubber tapping, even though greater profits can be made from rubber tapping, which leaves the forest intact. Thus, some environmentalists argue that Tropicorp's actions do not serve even its own economic interest. However, the initial investment required for a successful rubber-tapping operation is larger than that needed for a cattle ranch; there is a shortage of workers employable in rubber-tapping operations; and taxes are higher on profits from rubber tapping than on profits from cattle ranching. Consequently, the environmentalists' conclusion is probably wrong. ","In the economist's argument, the two boldface portions play which of the following roles?",The first states the conclusion of the economists' argument: the second supports that conclusion.,The first supports the conclusion of the environmentalists' argument; the second states that conclusion.,Each supports the conclusion of the economist's argument.,The first states the conclusion of the environmentalists' argument; the second states the conclusion of the economist's argument,3,val_332
"Mayor of Smalltown: Instituting high taxes on sodas, which are currently untaxed in Smalltown, has been shown in the past year to encourage people to reduce their intake of soda and live healthier lifestyles. Because the effects of such taxes on local businesses have not yet been determined, though, I believe we should wait before implementing such a tax. Activist: Your position is inconsistent with previous actions you have taken. You have implemented many laws that have decreased local businesses' revenues in order to help consumers, so concern for local businesses cannot be the true reason you refuse to pass this law now.",The activist's argument is flawed because it fails to consider that,the effects of taxes on local businesses may not be immediately apparent in all cases.,the health effects of some types of sodas may be different than the health effects of others.,"it is possible to weigh known drawbacks against known benefits, but not possible to weigh unknown drawbacks in the same way.",soda consumption has been strongly linked to rates of obesity and shorter lifespans.,2,val_306
"Consumer advocate: The toy-labeling law should require manufacturers to provide explicit safety labels on toys to indicate what hazards the toys pose. The only labels currently required by law are labels indicating the age range for which a toy is intended. For instance, a ""three and up"" label is required on toys that pose a choking hazard for children under three years of age. Although the current toy-labeling law has indeed reduced the incidence of injuries to children from toys, parents could prevent such injuries almost entirely if toy labels provided explicit safety information.","Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the consumer advocate's argument?",Many parents do not pay attention to manufacturers labels when they select toys for their children.,Most parents believe that the current labels are recommendations regarding level of cognitive skill.,The majority of children injured by toys are under three years of age.,Choking is the most serious hazard presented to children by toys.,1,val_336
